Bootstrap widgets
===============

This directory contains several Bootstrap Widgets, such as an Ajax ColorPicker, an Ajax Navbar, and an Ajax DateTimePicker. These widgets
are either a part of the core Bootstrap CSS framework, or they are extension widgets built on top of bootstrap. Widgets you can find here are
as follows.

* [ColorPicker](colorpicker/) - Allows the user to pick a color.
* [DateTimePicker](datetimepicker/) - Allows the user to pick a date, and optionally a time.
* [Navbar](navbar/) - Creates a navigational "menu" with Ajax support.

To understand how these are built, please check out the documentation for the [common-widgets](../../common-widgets/).
