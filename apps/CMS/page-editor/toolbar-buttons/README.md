System42's CMS common toolbar buttons
========

This folder contains the common toolbar buttons for all page objects. If you wish to globally change which toolbar buttons exists
for every single page in your system, you can do so by creating a new file in here, that creates a button or some other type of widget,
which becomes automatically plugged into the main CMS as a toolbar button when editing a *[p5.page]*.
