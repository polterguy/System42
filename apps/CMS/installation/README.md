Installation Hyperlambda
========

This folder contains the Hyperlambda, necessary to install your server, the first time you start your system. Typically, it will
allow you to create a unique random server-salt, which is used to hash passwords and such for users. In addition, it will allow 
you to create a root account passsword.

These files will only be evaluated once, during the first startup and initial setup of your server.
