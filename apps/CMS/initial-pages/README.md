The System42 CMS initial pages
========

This folder contains the pages that are initially created in your CMS the first time your server starts.
If you wish to create your own distribution, with different pages in it, this is probably where you would
add these pages.

By default, System42's CMS will install two pages; A simple landing page, and an "app-loader" page, which allows
you to start your System42 apps.

To understand the "app-loader", see the [apps] (/core/p5.webapp/system42/apps/) folder, and its documentation.
